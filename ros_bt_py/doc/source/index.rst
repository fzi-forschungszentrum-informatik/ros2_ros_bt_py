Welcome to ros_bt_py's documentation!
=====================================

ros_bt_py is a Python package for Behavior Trees

It is built to enable high-level (aka task level) mission control for
robots, similar to BehaviorTree.Cpp_, SMACH_, FlexBE_ or RAFCON_.

The library holds both the basic framework holding ros_bt_by together
and a sort of "standard library" of Behavior Tree nodes
(i.e. subclasses of :class:`ros_bt_py.node.Node`) that allow the
construction of complex robot mission Behavior Trees.

For information on how to create your own node classes, see :ref:`creating-nodes`
