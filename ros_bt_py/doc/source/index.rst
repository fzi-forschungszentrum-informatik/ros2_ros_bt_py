************
Introduction
************

ros_bt_py is a Python package for writing and executing Behavior Trees.

It is built to enable high-level (aka task level) mission control for
robots, similar to BehaviorTree.Cpp_, SMACH_, FlexBE_ or RAFCON_.

The roy_bt_py repository is home to multiple elements enabling you to quickly get started with BT
development without the need to write any code:

* The basic framework holding ros_bt_by together.
* A "standard library" of Behavior Tree nodes (i.e. subclasses of :class:`ros_bt_py.node.Node`)
  that already allow the construction of complex robot mission Behavior Trees.
  While these will let you do basically whatever you want,
  :ref:`writing your own nodes<creating-nodes>` might be helpful after you are familiar with the
  library.
* The ros_bt_py web GUI, which should in general be your interface to interact with the library.
  Generating trees through code is currently possible, but neither supported nor documented.

Mission Statement
*****************

ros_bt_py was created with the following goals in mind:

* Fully ROS compatible.
* Mission control for Robots, meaning long runing processes.
* Possiblity to distribute it among multiple robots to enable cooperation in robot Teams.
* Extendible, understandable and typesafe implementation.

It is meant as a high level control option similar to SMACH or FlexBE.
