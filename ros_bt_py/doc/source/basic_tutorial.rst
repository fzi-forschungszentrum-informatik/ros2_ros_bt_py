Starting up ros_bt_py
*********************

To get started launch the library in a sourced shell by running

.. code-block:: bash

  ros2 launch ros_bt_py ros_bt_py.launch.py

***********************
Examining the Interface
***********************

Then you can open a browser and go to http://localhost:8085/index.html to open the BT Editor which
should look like this:

.. image:: _static/gui_empty.png
   :alt: Empty GUI


The interface consists of four major parts: The Top Menu Bar, a Package Loader, the Node List and
the large Editor Window.

Menu Bars
=========

On the top of the GUI there are two menu bars, the Top Bar for general control as well as a Support
Bar below that.
The Top Menu Bar contains (from left to right):

* An indicator to show that the editor is connected to a behavior tree instance
* A dropdown menu to select which ROS namespace to monitor (you can run multiple behavior trees in
  different namespaces)
* A refresh button
* A special config button to change the address of the rosbridge server
* Options to enable publishing of subtree data making it easier to monitor complex trees.
* Buttons to control the execution of the currently loaded BT.
* Buttons to load a BT from, or save it to, a ROS package.
* Buttons to upload a BT YAML to the editor or download the YAML of the currently loaded BT

The Support Bar contains:

* A Tree selection window to select the displayed tree, especially useful when using Subtrees.
* Toggle Buttons for the Data Graph (more on that later) and the GUI itself if you want a
  fullscreen view.
* The Name field, which is not really useful???? TODO: Fix?
* The State Field showing the state of the tree, also more on that later.

Package Loader
==============

The Package Loader can be used to load additional Node Classes for use.
To load a new package enter the qualified path of the Python module that contains them and
click the Load Package button.
The Node Classes in the loaded module should now show up in the Node List.
Using the package loader is recommended for Node Class development, while building trees with custom
nodes loading Node Classes through :ref:`an advanced launch config<advanced-launch-config>` is
recommended to save time.

Node List
=========

Below the Package Loader a List of all currently available nodes can be found.
The search window on top of the list can be used to restrict the list of displayed nodes.
The search is applied to the node names as well as the node package name.
By hovering over the question mark a detailed Node Class description can be accessed.
Left-clicking on a Node Class selects it for insertion into the BT through the Node Menu.
The node can also be dragged into the Editor Window to directly place it into the BT.

Editor Window
=============

The editor canvas shows the currently loaded BT.
While running a tree the editor always shows the state of the tree nodes and can be used for
debugging.
While editing the nodes in the canvas can be dragged around and rearranged freely.

Node Menu
=========

.. image:: _static/gui_node_menu.png
   :alt: GUI with active Node Menu

When a node in the tree is selected the Node Menu for that node appears.
Here the node itself can be configured or deleted and both the Node Options as well as its Inputs
and Outputs are shown.
When selecting a node during execution the current In- and Outputs can be seen through the Node
Menu.
While interacting with Edges they can also be deleted in the Node Menu.

Writing your first BT
*********************

Before we get into the gritty details of BTs let's write a first, very basic, tree.
If you want to learn about the details first you can also come back to this section later.

1. Make sure the Tree is not currently running
==============================================

To compose a BT, the tree must not currently be in the RUNNING state.
It is easiest to ensure this by clicking the Shutdown button on the top.


#. Click "Shutdown" once and make sure the State Field shows "EDITABLE"

.. image:: _static/first_tree_0.png
  :alt: Empty GUI in EDITABLE State

2. Add a control flow node
==========================

To start building the BT, you will have to add nodes from the Node List on the left.
It is common to start by adding a Sequence or Fallback node as the root of the BT.

#. Type "sequence" into the search box and click the Sequence node.
#. Customize the nodeâ€™s name by setting it to "HelloSequeunce".
#. Add it to the BT by clicking the "Add to Tree" button.

.. image:: _static/first_tree_1.png
  :alt: GUI with a Sequence Node

3. Add a leaf node to the tree
==============================

Now we add leaf nodes to the Sequence to actually make the tree do something

#. Type "const" into the Search Box.
#. Drag Constant from the node list and drag it into the dark rectangle below the "HelloSequence"
   node.

.. image:: _static/first_tree_2.png
  :alt: GUI with Sequence while Constant is added

4. Modify the Constant node
===========================

After adding the node to the tree it needs to be adjusted to to what we want it to.

#. Click on the Constant node in the canvas that was just added.
#. Change the Name to "Constant_1".
#. Change the constant_type to "str" (this will automatically be expanded to "builtin.str").
#. Change the constant_value to "hello".
#. Press update node to commit the changes.
#. The canvas and properties will be updated.

.. image:: _static/first_tree_3.png
  :alt: Modifying the Constant Node

5. Add a second Constant and a processing step
==============================================

One Constant is nice, but it can't do a lot by itself.

First we add another Constant node:

#. Add another constant node by dragging it to the right of the first one.
#. Change its type to string and set the name value to "World".

.. image:: _static/first_tree_3.png
  :alt: Modifying the Constant Node

#. Search for "Concat" in the Search Box and select StringConcatenation by dragging it to the
   right of the constants.

6. Connecting the Data Wirings
==============================

Inputs and Outputs of all nodes in the tree are marked as gray squares adjacent to the nodes in
the Editor Window.
When hovering over the little dot on the Constant Nodes you should see the output type.
Data Wirings are created by simply clicking and dragging from an Input to an Output of the same
type or vice versa.
Compatible Inputs or Outputs are highlighted while dragging, as shown in the picture below.

#. Connect the Outputs of the Constants to the processing node.

.. image:: _static/first_tree_4.png
  :alt: Connecting the Node Wirings

7. Run the finished tree
========================

After creating a tree we need to run it to verify our work.
When the tree is finished we should see the "StringConcatenation" node Output being "HelloWorld".
A successful run of the tree is indicated by the State Field displaying "IDLE".

#. Run the Tree by pressing "Tick Until Result".
#. Make sure the State Field is displaying "IDLE".
#. Click the "StringConcatenation" node to verify Inputs and Output in the Node Menu.

Working with bt_py
******************

While working with bt_py it is important to understand both the tree structure created by the
arrangements of different nodes as well, the Data Graph used to share information between the
nodes as well as the control of the tree in general.
This section will give an overview of the processing of a BT, the Node Class Types that are
available, how to use them effectively and all you need to know about the Data Graph.

Tree Execution
==============

Before we talk about the building blocks of a BT in more detail a short introduction to the actual
tree execution is needed to understand the effect of e.g. different Flow Control Node Classes in the
next sections.

Ticking
-------

Traversal through the tree is done by "ticking" the tree.
On Tick the node that is currently next in line will receive a tick command and execute its internal
"do_tick" method.
This can lead to a multitude of results depending on the Node Class of the ticked node.
In a standard configuration bt_py is trying to tick at a rate of 10 Hz.

Tree States
-----------

To check the health of your tree and determine your next steps e.g. on a successful run of the tree
you need to understand the different Tree States as shown in the State Field

* EDITABLE:
  The tree is currently not running and changes can be made in the canvas.
* RUNNING:
  The tree is currently running and no changes can be made.
  Everything is great.
* IDLE:
  The tree reached a terminal state, but you will have to call Shutdown before you are able to edit
  it.
* ERROR:
  The tree reached an error state while executing.
  Something went wrong - find the bug.

Execution modes
---------------

When running a tree the Top Bar gives you multiple execution modes to choose from:

* Tick Once:
  Run exactly one single Tick through the tree.
  Especially useful when trying to debug a faulty tree.
* Tick Periodically:
  Run Ticks until Shutdown is called.
  After a successful run the tree will reset and start again instead of going into the IDLE state.
* Tick Until Result:
  Run Ticks until Shutdown is called or the tree transitions into the IDLE state.
* Stop:
  TODO: Does this do something?
* Reset:
  Reset the tree.
  This will not change the Tree State and should only be called while IDLE.
  Data in the tree as well as the Node States of the tree nodes will be reset.
* Shutdown:
  Halt and shut down the tree completely.
  This is your get out of jail free card.
  Use this to get into EDITABLE to edit your tree from any other Tree State.

Nodes
=====

Nodes are the backbone of each tree, creating the control flow in the BT as well as actually doing
something.
Every Node belongs to a Node Class, determining what the Node will do when it gets ticked.
Additionally each node is assigned a Node State, representing its current condition and defining the
behavior the Node will display when ticked.

Node States
-----------

Node States are shown by a color coded frame which can be used to visually debug a tree during
runtime.
Additionally Node States can affect the flow of the tree and which nodes are ticked through Flow
Control Nodes.

TODO: ARE THESE ENOUGH?

* UNINITIALIZED:
  An uninitialized node is a node in a tree that has not been executed.
  The node will have a gray frame while being in this state.
  When ticking any node in a tree all uninitialized nodes will transition to IDLE.
* IDLE:
  An idle node has not yet been ticked, but is ready to be ticked.
  The node will have a light blue frame while being in this state.
  Calling Reset will reset all nodes in the tree to IDLE.
* SUCCEEDED:
  A succeeded node has reached its terminal state and its action was successful.
  The node will have a light green frame while being in this state.
* FAILED:
  A failed node has reached its terminal state and its action failed.
  The node will have a light red frame while being in this state.
  Failing does not mean something went wrong!
* BROKEN:
  A broken node has encountered an error while executing and will set the Tree State to ERROR.
  The node will have a dark red frame while being in this state.
  Broken nodes mean something is wrong - most probably in your node implementation.
* SHUTDOWN:
  A shut down node means Shutdown was called on the whole tree and all nodes should be in that
  state.
  The node will have a dark red frame, similar to the BROKEN state.

Node Class Types
----------------

Node Classes are grouped into three Types: Flow Control, Decorator and Leaf nodes.
Types are defined by their allowed number of Child Nodes (Nodes that are below the respective node
in the tree) which underlines their intended usage.

* Flow Control Nodes are allowed to have an unlimited amount of Child Nodes.
  They are used to control the general execution of the tree and create the structure of the tree.
* Decorator Nodes are allowed to have exactly one Child Node.
  They are used to apply conditions to this single child, such as ignoring its terminal state or
  repeating the execution.
* Leaf Nodes are the nodes that actually do something, such as providing or processing data.

Data Graph
==========

To distribute data between nodes bt_py uses a Data Graph instead of a blackboard implementation as
it is used in bt_cpp and other implementations.

This means that data needs to be explicitly wired between Inputs and Outputs of the individual
nodes, but you don't need to worry about which entries are in your blackboard at a certain time.

To wire Data draw a graph edge from an input to an output or vice versa.
While both Inputs and Outputs can have multiple connections at the same time, allowing for complex
information flow in the tree, Inputs need to have at least one connection for the tree to start
execution, as ticking a node without a set Input would lead to undefined behavior.
Outputs do not need to have a connection and can be left empty.

Output values are only sent through the Data Graph when the node they are attached to is ticked, so
make sure that your control flow takes that into account.

Input and Output data types need to match when creating an edge, which can lead to problems when
changing Node Classes for already connected trees.
To ensure easy tree manipulation delete edges from nodes before changing the node or the Node Class
implementation.

Working with larger trees
=========================

As soon as there is more than one Node in the BT, Nodes can be moved via drag & drop.
While dragging a Node, translucent drop targets appear at the positions it can be moved to.
The canvas can be scrolled freely, either by clicking and dragging on the background or by moving
the cursor close to one of its corners while dragging a Node or Wiring.
